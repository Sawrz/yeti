# Yet another Trajectory Interface (YetI)

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Sawrz/yeti/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=pR6D7Bl01F)](https://codecov.io/gh/Sawrz/yeti)

YetI help you to analyze your biomolecular simulations made with GROMACS. Under the hood, it uses MDTraj to load the binary file. However, the problem with MDTraj is that it has limited support for nucleic acids. That's where YetI comes to the rescue. 
It helps you load your simulation files and extract features like angles, dihedrals, distances, and hydrogen bonds. 

There is still a lot to do to make it worthwhile for others, e.g., proper documentation. Since it's a one-person project, help is appreciated.
